## Give - Database HealthCheck
This plugin will check and identify the duplicate sources attached to the stripe customer of all the donors stored in the *give_donors table and then will remove all those duplicate sources from Stripe dashboard.

*Note:* Use this plugin only if you're facing any issues while donating due to stripe limitation on sources with Stripe add-on `2.1.2`.
